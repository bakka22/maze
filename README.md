Maze Project

Maze is a semi 3D game where you try to escape the maze
while facing and killing enemies, I did this project alone
which was a big benefit for me because I learned so much
from it and I enjoyed coding every bit of it. being a simple
game I focused on graphics to get the ultimate experience 
from it.

Since I was a child I admired video games, from snake on nokia phones to atari games to today's ps5 modern games, I was facinated by all of these games and I wanted to know how these great things were made, and with alx i had the opportunity to read about SDL library in C and Ray Casting algorithm to make my own game, and the experience was nothing less than amusement.

* Installation:
	use gcc compiler with SDL flags to compile all .c files to make the executable.

	gcc *.c -o <executable_name> `sdl2-config --cflags --libs` -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image 

* Usage:
	execute a the file providing the map file name as an argument:

./<executable_name> <map_file_name>
a map file called map is provided or you can create your own mapfile.
the syntax for a map file is:

first line:
player's x, y coordinates terminated by a semicolon.
for example:
53, 86;
-------
second line:
enemies x, y coordinates seperated with semicolons.
for example:
43, 59; 23, 243; 65, 23;
-------
third line:
first value represent the map's width, the second value represent the map's height.
for example:
20, 20;
-------
fourth to the last line:
represents the map.
use 1 to represent a wall and 0 for no wall.
a line represents a row which has width columns.
for example if the dimensions of the map is 6, 5 the map would look something like this:

1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1;

1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1;

1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1;

1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1;

1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1;

**NOTE: it is very important that the dimensions provided are consistant
with the rows and columns of the map, otherwize the game might crash.

Technologies used to develop the game:
1- Ray Casting:
So the idea of Ray Casting is to make a 3D world out of a 2D world, a 2D world which consists of a grid containing cells and each cell either contains a wall or it doesn't.
so according to the player's position and the direction it's facing, rays are casted, and when a ray hits the wall it records the distance from the player, and this distance is then used to render the the wall on the screen, for example if the distance is small the wall would appear bigger and for greater the distance the smaller the wall would appear.
for example: the following picture shows a 2D world

and the final 3D world would look something like this:

As simple as ray casting algorithm might seem, it took more than a week to implement it, I would wake up every day, bring a white paper and a pen and do the math manually, but when i turn it into code it doesn't work, at first I refused to watch a youtube tutorial about ray casting but after a lot of failure i decided to watch one, and i still couldn't get it ðŸ¤£
the problem was that i was able to detect only horizontal walls and after i solved that i wasn't able to detect both vertical and horizontal walls at the same time.
after a lot of papers, math and youtube tutorials i was finally able to solve both problems, for the first one i figured that the math for the vertical walls is lightly different from the math for the horizontal ones, and on the second problem i figured that the main loop that detects both walls should not break after it detects one of them because sometimes they do not go simultaneously and the vertical wall might be closer on the next iteration than the horizontal wall on this one and vice versa.

2- SDL library:
for creating the window and rendering everything on it, I used SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library in C, its simpleness and ease of use made it a great choice to work with.
